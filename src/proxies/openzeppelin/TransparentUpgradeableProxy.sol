/**
 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.
 *
 * Unlike the original OpenZeppelin implementation, this contract does not prevent the admin from calling the implementation.
 * This potentially exposes the admin to a proxy selector attack. See
 * https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector clashing].
 * When using this contract, you must ensure that the implementation function selectors do not clash with the proxy selectors.
 * The proxy selectors are:
 * - 0x3659cfe6: upgradeTo
 * - 0x4f1ef286: upgradeToAndCall
 * - 0x8f283970: changeAdmin
 * - 0xf851a440: admin
 * - 0x5c60da1b: implementation
 *
 * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
 * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
 * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
 * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
 * implementation.
 *
 * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler
 * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function
 * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could
 * render the admin operations inaccessible, which could prevent upgradeability. Transparency may also be compromised.
